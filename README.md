Turns will proceed based upon the current direction. A right facing arrow means the turn order goes down the list, a left facing arrow means it goes up the list. 
When your turn arrives you can pick a card out of you hand, if you do not have a playable card, typing -1 or any non-number character will give you a card and move on to the next player.
The first player to play their last card wins!
